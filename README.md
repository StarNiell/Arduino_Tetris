# Description
This project is a simple and common sketch for Arduino UNO of the hystoric "Tetris Game". 
The source c0de was hinerit from other common source code available on internt with a very few changes, as the "GAME OVER" label at the end of every game.


## Component List
* Arduino Uno R3 (or Nano, all compatible device)
* Display OLED SD1306 (Warning! It works at 3.3 V)
* Joystic (analogic 5 pin)
* Buzzer 3 pin 
* Lithium Battery 3,7 V
* Charge and boost module for Litium Battery
* Simple switch On/Off

**NOTE**: Pay attention to the voltage on the 5 Volt pin of Arduino. Befor to connect the Charge Boost Module, set a 5V output with a screewdriver
